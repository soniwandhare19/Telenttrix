            Funding Autoimmune Research

            In August 2013, Artech donated $1 million to the Hackensack University Medical Center Foundation to fund the “Artech Autoimmune
            Cell Re-Education Study.” The donation funded the efforts of Dr.
            Yong Zhao, whose pioneering research and clinical trials on Type One
            Diabetes have been expanded to cover a wide range of autoimmune
            diseases.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3 text-justify font-semibold text-gray-900">
            Artech believes that this funding will help millions of Americans
            who are inflicted with autoimmune diseases such as Type One
            Diabetes, Alopecia Areata, Multiple Sclerosis, Crohn’s Disease,
            Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Celiac Disease. This will in turn help
            advance this research to find a cure that will help millions of
            children in the U.S. and across the world.

              Artech is a long-term supporter of Ekal Vidyalaya, and the company

              In February 2020, Artech invested in Ekal’s Gramothan Resource
              Center in Hoshangabad, India. The Ekal Gramothan Centers work
              towards positively transforming rural lives by creating

              rural & tribal India, to help eradicate illiteracy. The schools are
