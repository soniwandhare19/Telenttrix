            At Artech, we believe that each of us is equally invested in
            creating a better tomorrow. As a part of our various efforts, our

            money for various charities.

            As part of our health and wellness program, Artech instituted a 100
            Days of Summer Challenge in 2017 for employees to walk a collective
            50 million steps. At the end of the successful program, Artech
            donated $5,000 to various charitable organizations including St.
            Jude Children’s Research Hospital, The Waterboys Foundation, and the
            Wounded Warrior Project. Artech has continued this program for the
            past four years.
